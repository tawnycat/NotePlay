<h1>NotePlay</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
<p>NotePlay is an application where users can interact with a virtual piano through their very own keyboard (so no need for a controller!). Equipped with sheet music and a metronome, users can learn simple songs. NotePlay keeps track of the accuracy of the user's keystrokes, and their score will be calculated and saved to their account by the end of the song.  </p>
